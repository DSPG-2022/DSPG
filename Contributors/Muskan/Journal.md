# Projects
### 1. Local Foods
The Iowa State Farm Food and Enterprise Development (FEED) is frequently asked for benchmarks on pricing of products both in retail and wholesale spaces. This occurs both within feasibility studies for new farm and food businesses and market assessments, as well as appropriate price points for selling to schools and early care sites, hospitals, universities, and other institutions. There is a need for additional data and research on the potential sales point for these wholesale products when many of our specialty crop producers across the state are operating in direct-to-consumer retail spaces.
1. Narrowing down the exact products that will be selected for inclusion in the initial market 
(It is currently anticipated that key products may include strawberries, peppers, cucumbers, sweet corn, melons and apples (rhubarb, honey, preserves, eggs, greens etc. might be current products being sold). If appropriate, this list may also include nuts, mushrooms and hydroponic greens or possibly dairy (local creameries, not AE)
2. Discuss and identify possible data sources. several potential sources for collecting information have already been identified as preliminary sources. Many of these programs are already program partners with the FEED team. 
3. Investigate the possibility of scraping data about local food prices and availability from social media, e-commerce websites or similar sources (specifically around wholesale distribution)
 -- Use Google Trends to identify other potential key products by terms being searched for. Potential for geographic scope of searches. 
-- Explore options for similar searches on Twitter or Facebook (Facebook marketplace) using appropriate API’s
-- Local food market place, 
4. Compare the values of the collected data with that provided by the USDA to determine if this process of collecting local data has the potential to better help producers with their decision making. – This might be done in collaboration with data being collected by the other AgMRC commodities DSPG team.
5. Collect data and develop a public interface as a dashboard showcasing the market benchmarks as a series of interactive visuals.
6. Identify potential aspects of the project that could be automated for future data collection and continual benchmarking
7. Investigate and/or demonstrate potential use of AI to help identify impacts to local food markets. For example, weather impacts. Alternatively utilize AI to monitor where there are potential shortages or surpluses of a product in a geographic area.

### 2. AgMRC Commodities
AGMRC Commodity reports can be used as preliminary research in determining current production, market analysis, demographic data and price points. It can be useful in applying for a wide variety of grant funding, financial institutional loans, etc. The customizable marketing studies provide Value Added Producer Grant (VAPG) applicants with market intelligence that can easily be incorporated into feasibility studies and business plans that support the application process. 

1.Creation of two new interactive commodity reports (Beef and Poultry/Eggs)by utilizing Tableau
2.Expand on the dashboard templates developed by DS401 Students and on Indicators website.
3.Reports to include demographics page (population, race, ethnicity, family structure, income) and food data(food deserts, food security, types ofmarkets –schools, restaurants)
4.Developing better geographic filters to include national, state, potentially county level. 
5.Standardization of all the reports in terms on generation, colors,and style. 
6.Creating a data repository for data sources with accompanying data visualizations.
7.Integrate with Market maker to include the map of producers and think of other ways to utilize the data provided.

# Weekly Pogress Journal
## Week_1

#### Monday - 5/23/2022
Worked on setting up github and the Introduction presentation
#### Tuesday - 5/24/2022
I started the visualisation geospatial course in R. Got to learn the basic get_map and ggmap function. How can we use layers with ggplot. For example, in terms of house sales data how to use coordinates. Swap ggplot with gg map in changing size or colour by year.
#### Wednesday - 5/25/2022
1. Introduction or brief overview about the projects
2. Worked on R exercise 
The question I was trying to answer is:
What is the distribution of chocolates? (slide 1)
Which color to choose for the flavor you want? (slide 2 -7)
For example Choosing a yellow color increases the chances of getting peanut butter(Slide 2)
#### Thursday - 5/26/2022

##### *A-Day ( Day 1) - Local Foods
Review project overview and visit the listed websites. Using Google Trends and other social media (Facebook Marketplace), search to find any trends in the types of products searched for and determine if there are any geographic trends or specific products that are orhave been searched for. Recognize difference in direct to customers and consumer/wholesale sales. Record any prices found along with search criteria. There are several web resources for learning how to use Google Trends and GT with R. A few examples include:ohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz6TLG9cUa0ohttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtrendsR/gtrendsR.pdfoDataScience+ Analyzing Google Trends Data in R https://datascienceplus.com/analyzing-google-trends-data-in-r/oR Bloggers: Analyse Google Trends Search Data in R using {gtrendsR} https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/06/analyse-google-trends-search-data-in-r-using-gtrendsr/oFixing Google Trends Data Limitations https://towardsdatascience.com/trendecon-essential-r-package-to-construct-time-series-from-google-trends-36365ea48382oPackage ‘gtrendsR’  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtrendsR/gtrendsR.pdf

###### Team Tasks
Maxwell : To start with the Gtrends R code with 5 commodities. For the R code to calculate hits you can use the keywords like strawberries, peppers, cucumbers, sweet corn, melons and apples (rhubarb, honey, preserves, eggs, greens, dairy products)                                                                           
Nabil : To start exploring multiple data sources

###### Team Results
Maxwell: We can only compare 5 commodities at a time. "Pepper" was at the top for IA. Code in the team work box folder  

Nabil: Data sources found useful:

###### Team Results
1. We can only pull 50,000 records at a time so we have to pull YOY data separately. 
2. Resolved the errors in setting up tableau and data sources.

*Nabil : To put the links of the dashboard for example top 10 commodities search and the helpful data sources in the same excel file. 

*Nayha : To put the code in the same folder.
###### Outcomes
1. Year decided for analysis: 2016-2021
2. Region decided for analysis: Global Vs Mid-West (The Midwest Area consists of ARS programs in 9 states -- Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Research is conducted by over 340 scientists and their respective support staff at 12 locations and 2 large Centers. The ARS locations are: Bowling Green, KY; Lexington, KY; West Lafayette, IN; Columbus, OH; Wooster, OH; Urbana, IL; Columbia, MO; Ames, IA; East Lansing, MI; St. Paul, MN; Morris, MN; Madison, WI; National Animal Disease Center, Ames, IA; and National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research, Peoria, IL.)
(# "US-KY","US-IA","US-IL","US-IN","US-MO","US-MI","US-MN","US-WI","US-OH")
###### Future work
1. Pick top 10 commodities for analysis 
2. Fix few data sources to start the work

#### Tuesday - 6/7/2022
##### *B-Day ( Day 2) - AgMRC Commodities
Team started working on creating tableau visualisation from past work
###### Team Tasks
All : Started creating a tableau report similar to the past work done. So basically learning to pull data from USDA (https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/) and putting it in tableau to create some visualisations.

###### Team Results
Everone presented their graphs on Honey, Eggs. All good!
###### Outcomes
1. Beef do not have county/state level data.....Rakesh to talk to the client to get this data or other option is to use the cattle data
Number of Beef Cows by State

The number of cattle in every state is a good indicator of how much beef each state produces. Seven states have over 1 million beef cows in 2021. The ten states with the highest number of beef cows are:


	
Texas - 4,685,000
	
Oklahoma - 2,189,000
	
Missouri - 2,035,000
	
Nebraska - 1,900,000
