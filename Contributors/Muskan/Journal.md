# Projects

## Week_1

#### Monday - 5/23/2022
Worked on setting up github and the Introduction presentation
#### Tuesday - 5/24/2022
I started the visualisation geospatial course in R. Got to learn the basic get_map and ggmap function. How can we use layers with ggplot. For example, in terms of house sales data how to use coordinates. Swap ggplot with gg map in changing size or colour by year.
#### Wednesday - 5/25/2022
1. Introduction or brief overview about the projects
2. Worked on R exercise 
The question I was trying to answer is:
What is the distribution of chocolates? (slide 1)
Which color to choose for the flavor you want? (slide 2 -7)
For example Choosing a yellow color increases the chances of getting peanut butter(Slide 2)

##### *A-Day ( Day 1) - Local Foods
Review project overview and visit the listed websites. Using Google Trends and other social media (Facebook Marketplace), search to find any trends in the types of products searched for and determine if there are any geographic trends or specific products that are orhave been searched for. Recognize difference in direct to customers and consumer/wholesale sales. Record any prices found along with search criteria. There are several web resources for learning how to use Google Trends and GT with R. A few examples include:ohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz6TLG9cUa0ohttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtrendsR/gtrendsR.pdfoDataScience+ Analyzing Google Trends Data in R https://datascienceplus.com/analyzing-google-trends-data-in-r/oR Bloggers: Analyse Google Trends Search Data in R using {gtrendsR} https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/06/analyse-google-trends-search-data-in-r-using-gtrendsr/oFixing Google Trends Data Limitations https://towardsdatascience.com/trendecon-essential-r-package-to-construct-time-series-from-google-trends-36365ea48382oPackage ‘gtrendsR’  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtrendsR/gtrendsR.pdf

###### Team Tasks
Maxwell : To start with the Gtrends R code with 5 commodities. For the R code to calculate hits you can use the keywords like strawberries, peppers, cucumbers, sweet corn, melons and apples (rhubarb, honey, preserves, eggs, greens, dairy products)                                                                           
Nabil : To start exploring multiple data sources

###### Team Results
Maxwell: We can only compare 5 commodities at a time. "Pepper" was at the top for IA. Code in the team work box folder  

Nabil: Data sources found useful:

##### *B-Day ( Day 1) - AgMRC Coomodities
1. Project Overview
2. Team started with installing tableau and reviewing past work

•Commodity Reports: https://indicators.extension.iastate.edu/projects/CommodityReport/

•Tableau Dashboards complete from DS401 -https://prod-useast-b.online.tableau.com/#/site/isueoced/projects/258461?:origin=card_share_link

•MAX DS401 Students work: https://prod-useast-b.online.tableau.com/t/isueoced/views/CranberryBook/content?:showAppBanner=false&:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link

###### Team Tasks
All : Started creating a tableau report similar to the past work done. So basically learning to pull data from USDA (https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/) and putting it in tableau to create some visualisations.

###### Team Results
1. We can only pull 50,000 records at a time so we have to pull YOY data separately. 
2. Resolved the errors in setting up tableau and data sources.



#### Friday - 6/3/2022
Assigned Exercise: Worked in A-Day team groups prepare a 10-minute visual presentation that profiles and compares / contrasts –Nebraska & Wisconsin on basis of 
1. Educational Attainment (HS Grad, Bachelor)
2. *Income (Median Household, Median Family, and Per capita)
3. *% Belowpoverty level
4. *Age demographics 
5. *Race demographics
6. *Population EstimatesoNumber of Housing Units (percent vacant households)oUnemployment rate
7. *% Inlabor force and the % not in labor force
8. *Primary occupations by numbero*Top agricultural products

## Week_3
#### Monday - 6/6/2022
##### *A-Day ( Day 2) - Local Foods
1. Complete work with Google Trends
2. Look at Facebook API (Facebook market place), Craigslist API or Twitter to see if we can identify producers advertising their products on those platforms
3. Discuss results from review of the websitesin the proposal
4. Discuss what the final product of this project might be exactly

###### Team Tasks
Idris, Muhammad Nabil Arif : Please create an excel with all the data sources and the information/columns like Price or quantity or year              
Skinner, Maxwell M : you can work on creating the graphs for 5 commodities with YOY (2016-21) and can analyze the trends/peaks                     
Hussain, Nayha [COMXT] : You can work on getting data from Twitter API/Facebook Marketplace for any commodity


###### Team Results
Maxwell : To put all the downloaded maps of trend analysis for 5 commodities YOY in the same folder and the script starting with the line 184 in a new R file. 
Nabil : To put the links of the dashboard for example top 10 commodities search and the helpful data sources in the same excel file. 
Nayha : To put the code in the same folder.
###### Outcomes
1. Year decided for analysis: 2016-2021
2. Region decided for analysis: Global Vs Mid-West (The Midwest Area consists of ARS programs in 9 states -- Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, Missouri, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Research is conducted by over 340 scientists and their respective support staff at 12 locations and 2 large Centers. The ARS locations are: Bowling Green, KY; Lexington, KY; West Lafayette, IN; Columbus, OH; Wooster, OH; Urbana, IL; Columbia, MO; Ames, IA; East Lansing, MI; St. Paul, MN; Morris, MN; Madison, WI; National Animal Disease Center, Ames, IA; and National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research, Peoria, IL.)
(# "US-KY","US-IA","US-IL","US-IN","US-MO","US-MI","US-MN","US-WI","US-OH")
###### Future work
1. Pick top 10 commodities for analysis 
2. Fix few data sources to start the work
3. Find out what data sources are used by USDA dashboards and can we pullit via API
