## What I've learned

- **R**
    1. Assessments showed that I was weakest in cleaning and importing data so I completed an _Introduction to the Tidyverse_ course.
    2. Started the course _Introduction to Importing Data in R_ for better understanding importing different file types from excel, csv, to SQL or other statistical databases.
