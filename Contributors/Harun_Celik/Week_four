## What I've learned

- **R**
    1. My code for webscraping for [Iowa State University's Mesonet](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/) could better be adapted to a function. I continued working to create a script that would be easier to pull information from.

    3. I continued my DataCamp training in R by focusing firstly on _Reshaping Data with tidyr_. The focus of this course was to get a better understanding of how to format data we receive in the projects using ```tidyr```.
