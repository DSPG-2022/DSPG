## What I've learned

- **R**
    1. The Farmer's Market project heavily focuses on the extraction of data from different weather organizations as well as datasets for soil data. As an important resource, I continued practicing with APIs and Web scraping by using [Iowa State University's Mesonet](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/). I continued my training in learning the ```rvest``` library.
