Today I began to work on the CED housing project
As someone who never had to much thought into this, it was very interesting to learn more about the issues coming with low income housing
I think learning  about the housing gap was very interesting because it showed that it wasn't just one factor affecting it, but a combination
of multiple factors, like not having enough housing in general for Extreme low income (ELI) __and__ the fact that people in higher income levels also have homes that would 
be considered viable for the ELI makes it even more of a struggle for them.
