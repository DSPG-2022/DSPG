## Week 6

During my A team days I explored the age demographics in the IVRS data set to get a better understanding into what ages were most common in the data.

I found that the age range our client wants us to look at (16 - 64) captures the large majority of the IVRS cases and is a good age range to look at.

I also found that there are a more male cases than female and that the number of cases over the years changes almost exactly the same between the two genders.

(i.e. where male cases increased/decreased, so did female cases)

Another item I worked on was adding county population information to the IVRS data set, this was later removed as it was ultimately not used.

During my B team days this week I continued working on my pultry and ESRI workbooks, creating new visuals and interactive dashboards.
