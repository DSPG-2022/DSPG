## Week 8

This week in my A team I continued looking at the new SAMSHA data set from the previous week to see if there was useful information we could use.

It was ultimatley determined that this wouldn't be used since the data was at a region level and the regions were different than the regions in the IVRS data and it was difficult to make comparisions. 

During my B team days I worked on getting new ESRI data. 

We got temporary licensing to ArcGIS Pro through Iowa State University and I was able to pull new 2021 data as well as predictions for 2026.

I was really excited about this as I thought it really helped flesh out the ESRI data portion since up until this point the newest data was from 2010.
