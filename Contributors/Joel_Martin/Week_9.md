## Week 9

During my A team days I begun working on a new data source from the MHDS. This data had expenditure and number of persons served information.

The data was in PDF format and I figured out a way to scrap the PDFs and get the data into CSV files for use in Tableau.

During my B team days I worked on finalizing the market consumption profile page for the egg and beef commodity reports. This report contains primarily the ESRI data I had been working on for the majority of the program.
