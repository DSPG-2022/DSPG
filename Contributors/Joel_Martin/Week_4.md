## Week 4

This week during my A team days I helped prepare and present for our first client meeting as a team this summer.

In this meeting we shared preliminary results and got some good feedback as to what was important to the client and what types of visuals would they like to see in the final product.

During my B team days I created a poultry Tableau workbook to explore the poultry USDA data.
