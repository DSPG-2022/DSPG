## Week 11

In my A team this final week I worked on our final presentation and script that was presented to our client, peers, and guests.

Feedback from the client was very positive and the projects dashboard deliverable will have an important part in the future of DHR.

During my B team days I worked on finalizing our presentation and my script for our final presentation.

The client was very happy with our final product as it closely aligned with the past teams commodity reports.
