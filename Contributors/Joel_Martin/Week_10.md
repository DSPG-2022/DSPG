## Week 10

In my A team this week, I begun creating visuals in Tableau for the MHDS expenditure data to see how spending compared across the Iowa regions.

During my B team days I worked on documentation for the steps I had taken to clean and transform the ESRI data.

I also worked with my other team members to merge our pages we had been working on into two single Tableau workbooks, one for eggs and the other for beef.
