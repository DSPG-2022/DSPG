## Week 5

During my A team days I continued to work on the IVRS dataset and explore wage information in more detail.

I updated the wage information in the data to better represent unemployed and 0 values. I also found an fixed issue with O'Brien county in Iowa missing and/or formatting the apostrophe incorrectly.

During my B team days I created a new workbook for ESRI consumer data to explore what was there for the egg and beef commodities.

We also had our first team meeting with our client who gave us some good feedback on our preliminary exploration into the new egg and beef commodity reports.
